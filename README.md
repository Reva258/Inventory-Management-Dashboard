During this virtual internship provided by HeroVired in collaboration with Belong I had the privilege to work extensively with Tableau Software, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis and business analytics

Business Objectives:
The business objective of this project was to analyze inventory data to identify trends and patterns in sales, stock levels, and customer demand. 
The goal was to gain insights into which products are selling well, which are underperforming, and where there may be opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce costs in the inventory management process. 
The analysis informed decisions around stocking levels, ordering frequency, and product promotions, with the ultimate aim of maximizing profitability and customer satisfaction. 
The Tableau dashboard will provide a clear and intuitive view of the inventory data, making it easy for stakeholders to access and understand the insights generated by the analysis.

Problem Statement:
Inventory management is a critical process for businesses to effectively track and control their stock of goods and materials. In this project, learners should aim to understand how inventory can be managed efficiently based on the provided dataset. By analyzing the data, they can gain insights into factors such as sales trends, popular products, customer preferences, and order fulfillment. The company conducting this project aims to improve their inventory management practices, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize sales strategies, and ultimately increase profitability. Through this project, the company seeks to obtain actionable insights that will help them make informed decisions and drive business growth.
